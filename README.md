# Spatial Warping and Perception Simulation

This project simulates various spatial and perception distortions, including effects similar to **Alice in Wonderland Syndrome** (AIWS). It includes three unique image manipulation effects that simulate the sensation of visual distortions, such as fisheye effects, swirling distortions, and zooming in and out. These effects create the illusion of altered space and perception.

## Features

- **Effect 1: Fisheye Effect**: This effect simulates the fisheye lens distortion, making the image appear as if viewed through a rounded lens. The edges of the image are stretched and distorted to create a bulbous effect.
  
- **Effect 2: Swirl Effect**: The swirl effect creates a rotating distortion, making it feel like the image is spinning or warping around a central point. This effect mimics the sensation of the world bending or twisting around you.
  
- **Effect 3: Zoom In/Out Effect (Pulsing)**: This effect simulates an image zooming in and out, giving the illusion of the image moving closer or farther away. The image pulsates in and out, mimicking a shift in spatial perception.

All effects involve real-time image manipulation using OpenCV and Python, allowing you to visually experience spatial distortions and warped perspectives.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `opencv-python`: For image manipulation and perspective transformations.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations and matrix manipulations.

You can install them via pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
